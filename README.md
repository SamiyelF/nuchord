# nuchord
nuchord is a chord making machine. set a key, and every button you press will generate a chord that works within that key!
## dependencies
- java
## usage
in your terminal:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/samiyelf/nuchord
cd nuchord
java src/main.js
```
## roadmap
- make the prebuilt effects actually work
- more controls (key switching, etc)
- pretty up the codebase
- make the gui pretty
- midi output?
## P.S.
nuchord costs 200 dollars to install and you definitely have to pay me to use it, please mail me cash as i do not care for online banking
